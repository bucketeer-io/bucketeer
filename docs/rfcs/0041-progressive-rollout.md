# Summary

# UI

We'll introduce two kinds of UI, "Manual Setting" and "Template Setting".

## Manual Setting

Users can determine any percentage and schedule in this UI.

## Template Setting

Manual Setting has a lot of flexibility, but itâ€™s hard when configuring a periodic increase in the percentage of a variation.
In this case, Template Setting is useful.

## Progress bar of rollout

# Important Notice

* Users can use Progressive Rollout when the number of variations is less than or equal to 2
* Users can't use same scheduled time in single auto ops rules. For example, users can not set true for 50% at 2023-01-01 00:06:00 and 80% at the same time.

# Processing flow

The following image is a processing flow in this feature.

For instance, Web Client sends clause as follows:

```go
&autoopsproto.ProgressiveRolloutClause{
	// The another varition id is vid-2
	VariationId: "vid-1",
	Schedules: []*autoopsproto.ProgressiveRolloutClause_Schedule{
		{
			// '2023-01-01 00:03:00'
			Time: 1672498980,
			Weight: 20000,
		},
		{
			// '2023-01-01 00:06:00'
			Time: 1672499160,
			Weight: 40000,
		},
		{
			// '2023-01-01 00:09:00'
			Time: 1672499340,
			Weight: 60000,
		},
	},
}
```

1. Web Client registers the above clauses by calling `CreateAutopOps` rules
2. Batch service call `ListAutoOpsRules`, and check if the current time is a scheduled time. In this case, it checks whether the current time is 2023-01-01 00:03:00.
3. If the current time is a scheduled time, Batch service call `ExecuteAutoOps`.
4. AutoOps service call`UpdateFeatureTargeting` to update feature rules. In this case, update the weight of vid-1 to 20000 and the weight of vid-2 to 80000.

# Changes

## Proto

### Progressive rollout

`Interval` field in `ProgressiveRolloutClause` is filled by client side when UI is Template Setting.
When we call `ExecuteAutoOps`, we'll send `time` field. AutoOps service will change `executed` flag of the time match to `true`.

```proto
message ProgressiveRolloutClause {
  string variation_id = 1;
  ProgressiveRolloutManualSchedule progressive_rollout_manual_schedule = 2;
  ProgressiveRolloutAutomaticSchedule progressive_rollout_automatic_schedule = 3;
}

message ProgressiveRolloutManualSchedule {
  message Schedule {
    int64 time = 1;
    int32 weight = 2;
    bool executed = 3;
  }
  repeated Schedule schedules = 1;
}

message ProgressiveRolloutAutomaticSchedule {
  enum Interval {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    HOURLY = 1;
    DAILY = 2;
    WEEKLY = 3;
  }
  int64 started_at = 1;
  Interval interval = 2;
}
```

### Other

In addition to this feature, we'll introduce `Type` field to `Clause` field. This will be used when filtering rules.

```diff
diff --git a/proto/autoops/clause.proto b/proto/autoops/clause.proto
index 8c17f23..af9dabf 100644
--- a/proto/autoops/clause.proto
+++ b/proto/autoops/clause.proto

+    DATE_TIME = 1;
+    WEBHOOK = 2;
+    PROGRESSIVE_ROLLOUT = 3;
+  }
 }
 ```

**NOTE**
We can't define `Type` in `AutoOpsRule` instead of `Clause` because `Clause` field in `AutoOpsRule` is an array.
There is a possibility that multiple `Clause` types are included.

## Backend Changes

### Major changes

* batch/job/progressive_rollout_watcher.go
    * This watcher updates feature rules at the scheduled time.
* batch/executor/rollout_updater.go
	* This is the executor which sends ChangeAutoOpsRuleExecutedCommand to AutoOpsRule service.

### Minor changes

* pkg/autoops/api/operation.go
    * We need to modify `ExecuteOperation`. When OpsType field in AutoOpsRule is PROGRESSIVE_ROLLOUT, we'll call `UpdateFeatureTargeting`.
* pkg/opsevent/batch/executor/executor.go
	* Rename executor.go to flag_triggerer.go
	* Then abstract executor.go such as https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/blob/main/pkg/eventpersisterdwh/persister/event.go.
* pkg/autoops/command/auto_ops_rule.go
	* Add new commands to `Handle` func.
