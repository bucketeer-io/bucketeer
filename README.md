## Why Bucketeer?

[Bucketeer](https://bucketeer.io) is an open-source feature management and experimentation platform created by CyberAgent that combines enterprise-grade capabilities with the flexibility of self-hosting. Unlike expensive SaaS solutions, Bucketeer gives you complete control over your feature flag infrastructure while delivering advanced automation, sophisticated A/B testing, and a polished user experience.

**Scale from startup to enterprise:** Start with Docker and scale to 100M+ users per month with Kubernetes. Battle-tested in production at scale.

**Advanced features, zero licensing costs:** Get progressive rollouts, Bayesian experimentation, automated operations, and comprehensive audit logging‚Äîall features typically locked behind expensive enterprise tiers.

**Unique capabilities others don't have:** Flag-based targeting rules (use one flag's result as a condition for another) and split audience rollouts (nested experiments like 50/50 tests on 5% of traffic) set Bucketeer apart from all alternatives.

**Superior A/B testing:** Bayesian statistical analysis delivers faster, more accurate results with smaller sample sizes compared to traditional frequentist approaches.

**Modern, intuitive UI/UX:** A thoughtfully designed interface that makes complex feature management accessible to both technical and non-technical team members.

## Core Capabilities

### üöÄ Advanced Feature Flag Management

Control feature releases with precision through a comprehensive suite of tools designed for modern software teams.

- **Targeted Rollouts:** Release features to specific users based on attributes, segments, or custom rules
- **Progressive Rollouts:** Automate gradual feature releases with customizable schedules (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **Split Audience Rollouts:** Run nested experiments‚Äîe.g., 50/50 A/B test on just 5% of traffic for ultimate control
- **User Segmentation:** Create reusable user segments with rule-based targeting and bulk user upload
- **Flag-based Targeting Rules:** Use one flag's evaluation result as a targeting condition for another flag‚Äîa unique capability for sophisticated user targeting
- **Flag Prerequisites:** Define hard dependencies between flags to control evaluation order and ensure required conditions
- **Multi-Environment Support:** Manage feature flags across unlimited environments with full project isolation

<details>
<summary><b>üéØ Advanced Targeting: Flag Rules vs Prerequisites</b></summary>

**Flag as Rule Condition** lets you target users based on another flag's evaluation result. Example: *"Show premium feature (Flag A) to users who got variation 'new-design' from Flag B."* This creates dynamic, cross-flag targeting logic.

**Prerequisites** enforce hard dependencies before evaluation. Example: *"Don't evaluate Flag A unless Flag B returns variation X."* If the prerequisite isn't met, Flag A returns its OFF variation immediately.

These complementary features enable sophisticated multi-flag targeting strategies impossible with other platforms.
</details>

### üß™ Bayesian A/B Testing & Experimentation

Make data-driven decisions faster with statistically superior experimentation.

- **Bayesian Statistical Analysis:** Get reliable results with smaller sample sizes and shorter experiment duration
- **Goal Tracking:** Define and measure custom conversion goals to evaluate feature impact
- **Multivariate Testing:** Test multiple variations simultaneously to find optimal solutions
- **Real-time Results:** Monitor experiment performance with live statistical significance calculations
- **Experiment Lifecycle Management:** Seamlessly transition from experiment to full rollout

### ‚öôÔ∏è Intelligent Automation

Reduce manual work and respond to issues instantly with built-in automation.

- **Auto Operations:** Schedule flag changes, trigger actions based on event rates, or create custom automation rules
- **Progressive Rollout Templates:** Pre-configured rollout patterns for common release strategies
- **Flag Triggers:** Webhook-based flag control for CI/CD pipelines and APM integration (Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, etc.)
- **Event-Driven Actions:** Automatically disable flags when error thresholds are exceeded
- **Multi-Schedule Support:** Chain multiple scheduled operations for complex release workflows

### üîê Enterprise Security & Compliance

Maintain control and meet compliance requirements with comprehensive governance features.

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Granular permissions with Viewer, Editor, and Owner roles per environment
- **Complete Audit Logging:** Track every change with detailed history including who, what, when, and why
- **API Key Management:** Secure SDK authentication with separate keys for client, server, and public API access
- **Environment Isolation:** Full data separation between environments and projects
- **Admin & Environment Accounts:** Flexible account structure for organizations of any size

### üîî Integrations & Notifications

Stay informed and integrate with your existing tools seamlessly.

- **Slack Notifications:** Real-time alerts for flag changes, experiment results, and system events
- **Flag Lifecycle Alerts:** Automatic Slack notifications for unused flags (7+ days inactive) to maintain clean codebase and improve latency
- **Webhook Triggers:** Integrate with monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, and custom automation
- **RESTful API:** Comprehensive HTTP API for programmatic flag management (Read/Write/Admin access levels)
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging support for instant SDK updates

### üìä Observability & Analytics

Understand how features are being used and make informed decisions.

- **Code References:** Automatically detect where flags are used in your codebase to maintain clean flag lifecycle
- **Feature Usage Tracking:** Monitor which features are actively used and by whom
- **Stale Flag Detection:** Automatic alerts for flags with no requests for 7+ days to prevent technical debt
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Track flag evaluation performance and cache hit rates
- **Goal Event Analytics:** Measure conversion rates and goal completions
- **Audit Trail:** Complete visibility into all system changes for debugging and compliance

### üéØ Developer Experience

Built by developers, for developers‚Äîwith the tools you need for modern development practices.

- **AI-Powered Workflows:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for [managing flags](https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer-mcp) and [querying documentation](https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer-docs-local-mcp-server) via AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Code References:** Track where flags are used in your source code to safely remove obsolete flags and prevent technical debt
- **Interactive Debugger:** Test flag evaluations for specific users without deploying‚Äîsupports batch testing multiple users and flags simultaneously
- **Trunk-Based Development:** Merge frequently without fear using feature flags to hide incomplete work
- **Local & Remote Evaluation:** Server SDKs support both evaluation modes for optimal performance
- **OpenFeature Compatible:** Use Bucketeer with the vendor-neutral OpenFeature standard
- **Hot Reload:** SDK updates without application restarts via push notifications
- **Type-Safe SDKs:** Well-designed SDKs with comprehensive documentation
