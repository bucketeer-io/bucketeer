# Summary

Audit logs is a feature to store the history of changes that we made to objects like Feature Flags, Push, API keys, … 
We can see the user who did the action in either the console or public APIs.

</div>

When this document was drafting, the editor who did the action is got from access token: 
https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/blob/main/pkg/role/role.go#L48-L74

For public APIs, the authorization method is API keys, so after our API gateway request to web gRPC service, 
the access token is got from internal environment, which is the service token 
(https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/blob/main/pkg/api/cmd/server.go#L114), so the email being shown 
in audit log for public API write action is always internal Bucketeer email, which is not really correct.

</div>

We need to save the signature (in this case, email) of the API creator or maintainer and decide who should be the editor 
then apply a mechanism to get the correct editor in api layer when making calls to the Web gRPC service.

# Solutions

## Problem 1: save the maintainer of API key when we create API key in Console

We can add a column `maintainer` in api_key table so the maintainer can be saved. For old api keys, we can use creator
in audit logs by filter type = 400 (create API key event) in audit_log table, select editor and `entity_id` 
⇒ migration data for old `api_key` records and migration data for old `audig_log` records.

Also, we need to hide the api key in the audit log snapshot, by adding a column `api_key` as new field to save api key
and the old `id` column would be the UUID of the API key.

  <img width="35%" src="/docs/rfcs/images/audit-log-snapshot.png" alt="audit log snapshot example">
</div>

**The message request of CreateAPIKey Web api should be:**

```protobuf
message CreateAPIKeyRequest {
  string environment_namespace = 1;
  string name = 2;
  account.APIKey.Role role = 3;
  string maintainer = 4;
}
```

As we add new properties to `api_key` object, the response of the `GetAPIKeyBySearchingAllEnvironments` API 
and `ListAPIKeys` API also return an extra `maintainer` and `id` field in `api_key` object:

```protobuf
message EnvironmentAPIKey {
  string environment_namespace = 1 [deprecated = true];
  APIKey api_key = 2;
  bool environment_disabled = 3;
  string project_id = 4 [deprecated = true];
  environment.EnvironmentV2 environment = 5;
  string project_url_code = 6;
  string maintainer = 7;
  string id = 8;
}
```

## Problem 2: Get the correct editor in API layer when making call to Web service
As we have saved API Key unique id, we can show it in the audit log like this (or just embed it in the api key name):
```
<key_name>-<id>-<creator_email> Feature flag has been created
```
I suggest 2 options:
  - Let the maintainer be the creator of the API key.
  - We let the client decide the editor of the action by adding editor email in the request body of public API.

### Option 1: Let the editor be the creator of the API key <span style="color:green">(preferred)</span>

We can extract the APIKey maintainer in function `getEnvironmentAPIKey` as we will update the response of 
`GetAPIKeyBySearchingAllEnvironments` (https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/blob/main/pkg/account/api/api_key.go#L455)

Now to save the API key maintainer to audit log, we need to overwrite the editor, 
the idea is to use context to share information between services.

The `maintainer` value will be added into context before forward to Web gRPC service:

```go
const APIKeyMaintainerMDKey string = "apikey-maintainer"
const APIKeyNameMDKey string = "apikey-name"
const APIKeyTokenMDKey string = "apikey-token"

headerMetadata := metadata.New(map[string]string{
    APIKeyMaintainerMDKey: envAPIKey.ApiKey.Maintainer,
    APIKeyNameMDKey:       envAPIKey.ApiKey.Name,
    APIKeyTokenMDKey:      envAPIKey.ApiKey.APIKey,
})
ctx = metadata.NewOutgoingContext(ctx, headerMetadata)
```

When receive request, we can get it from context metadata again 
(let’s add this in https://github.com/bucketeer-io/bucketeer/blob/main/pkg/role/role.go#L48-L74):

```go
md, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)
if ok {
    apiKeyMaintainer := md.Get(APIKeyMaintainerMDKey)
	apiKeyName := md.Get(APIKeyNameMDKey)
	apiKeyToken := md.Get(APIKeyTokenMDKey)
    apiKeyTokenShadowed := apiKeyToken[len(apiKeyToken)-8:] // shadowed token example
    // verify maintainer email then form *eventproto.Editor ...
}
```

Below is the overall updated flow to save the API key maintainer to audit log, 
red color means those are new flows that need to be implemented in this option:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img width="50%" src="/docs/rfcs/images/option-1-get-audit-log-maintainer.png" alt="option 1 flow">
</div>

**Pros and cons**

Pros:

- We don’t have to change the signature of any public or web API, no breaking change.
- Other than saving API keys and create migration for old data in the database, we only need to add 
API key maintainer to context before forward to web gRPC service (for every APIs) and overwrite the editor.
- The implementation can be fast and compact.

Cons:

- The editor is not fully specific, we only know the one that responsible for creating and maintaining the API, 
not the one that actually do the action.

### Option 2: let the client decide the editor of the action

In this option, we still save the API key maintainer in the audit log but also, we change the request body 
of update and create APIs by adding `creator_email` or `updater_email`:

```protobuf
message UpdateFeatureRequest {
  string comment = 1;
  string id = 2;
  google.protobuf.StringValue name = 3;
  google.protobuf.StringValue description = 4;
  repeated string tags = 5;
  google.protobuf.BoolValue enabled = 6;
  google.protobuf.BoolValue archived = 7;
  repeated feature.Variation variations = 8;
  repeated feature.Prerequisite prerequisites = 9;
  repeated feature.Target targets = 10;
  repeated feature.Rule rules = 11;
  feature.Strategy default_strategy = 12;
  google.protobuf.StringValue off_variation = 13;
  google.protobuf.StringValue updater_email = 14;
}
```

This solution is an extension of option 1, and we can reconstruct the audit log message for public API like this:
```
API creator: api-creator@bucketeer.io, Editor: editor@gmail.com
Push name has been updated
```

The code should change like this:
```go
// get editor and pass to context
const (
    APIKeyMaintainerMDKey = "apikey-creator"
	// ... other keys to identify apikey
    APIEditorMDKey        = "api-editor"
)

headerMetadata := metadata.New(map[string]string{
    APIKeyMaintainerMDKey: envAPIKey.ApiKey.Maintainer,
	// ... other keys to identify apikey
    APIEditorMDKey:     req.UpdaterEmail.value,
})
ctx = metadata.NewOutgoingContext(ctx, headerMetadata)
```
```go
// get editor from context
md, ok := metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)
if ok {
    apiKeyMaintainer := md.Get(APIKeyMaintainerMDKey)
    apiEditor := md.Get(APIEditorMDKey)
    
    editors := fmt.Sprint("API creator: %s, Editor: %s",
        apiKeyMaintainer,
        apiEditor,
    )
    // verify maintainer email then forming *eventproto.Editor ...
}
```
*The reason that we save both API maintainer and API editor but not one of them is because in case 
input `updater_email` is “anonymous@hacker.io” or something like that, we still do not know 
exactly who did the action. The target here should be what has happened and who did it.*

The new API flow should be below:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img width="50%" src="/docs/rfcs/images/option-2-get-audit-log-maintainer.png" alt="option 2 flow">
</div>

**Pros and cons:**

Pros:
- We can define exactly who is the editor of the object, the content is more specific.

Cons:
- We have to change the request of every current public APIs and their associated description.
- The audit log message format might be changed as well.
- For old audit log data, we can only know the editor is the API key creator (like option 1).
- The implementation is more time-consuming than option 1 as more changes.

## Migration Plan

1. Create migration to add new column `api_key` and `maintainer` in `api_key` table.
2. Update code in CreateAPIkey/GetAPIKey API: add `maintainer` as optional field in request and response. 
If the request `maintainer` is empty, we use the current console login account as the maintainer to avoid breaking change.
Save generated api key in column `api_key` instead of `id`. Generate `id` as UUID.
3. Update UI: add API key maintainer email field in the create new API key screen and in the list API keys screen.
4. Implement overwrite editor mechanism in the API layer.
5. Backup data in `api_key` table and `audit_log` table.
6. Create migration to copy data from `id` column to `api_key` column in `audit_log` table.
7. Get all records with type = 400 (create API key event) and get all editors as API maintainer of associated API.
From it, create migration to update maintainer of old API keys and generate new `id` as uuid. We also 
update `editor` field in `audit_log` table for old write actions via API key in the same migration.
